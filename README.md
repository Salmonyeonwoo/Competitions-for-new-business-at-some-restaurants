🏪 Smart Franchise VoC Management & Education Recommendation System (Prototype)
"Diagnose problems with data, provide solutions with education."

This is a prototype of a smart management solution that analyzes Voice of Customer (VoC) data from franchise stores in real-time to identify the most urgent issues for each store and automatically matches them with appropriate employee training content.

📖 Overview
Various customer complaints arising in the franchise field are fatal to brand image. However, it is difficult for store owners to control every situation, or for inexperienced part-time staff to respond appropriately.

This project is designed beyond a simple dashboard showing the status of customer complaints, to ensure that data analysis results lead directly to 'behavioral change (education)' in the field. It moves beyond "What is the problem?" to provide concrete audiovisual solutions in real-time for "So, what needs to be taught?".

🎯 Core Objectives
Prevent Customer Churn: Induce immediate response by capturing urgent complaints (ratings of 2 stars or below) in real-time.

Standardize Service Quality: Distribute the headquarters' standard training manuals to the right place at the right time based on branch-specific data.

Data-Driven Store Operations: Diagnose and improve store problems based on actual data, not vague feelings.

✨ Key Features
1. 📊 Real-time VoC Status Dashboard
Provides intuitive metrics to grasp the store's current situation at a glance.

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): Displays weekly average rating, total number of receipts, and number of customers requiring urgent action.

Data Visualization: Analyzes the incidence rate by complaint type (bar chart) and recent rating trends (line chart).

2. 🎓 AI-Powered Smart Coaching (Actionable Insight)
[Core Competency of This Project] Automatically recommends the most urgent training content based on data analysis results.

Automatic Problem Diagnosis: Automatically identifies the complaint type that occurs most frequently in the current store (e.g., service attitude, hygiene, etc.).

Customized Video Training Recommendation: Immediately provides the headquarters' standard training video guides (thumbnails) tailored to the problem type.

On-Site Manual Provision: Displays visual materials (photo manuals) that staff can check at all times.
